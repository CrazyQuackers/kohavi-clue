Clue for my family

This Clue tool helps organize all the cards in a safe place.
Every player enters and gets his cards on his laptop/mobile device.
This removes the danger of cards being leaked.
In addition, If a card got ripped, that card will be easily recognizable.
The host will choose the game version: Clue (the normal version) or Gift
(you can change the Gift version to whatever you want in the cards.index file, make sure to change the images in the Card.vue file aswell)
It is good to have an experienced coder do this part, things might get ruined from this change so go over the code to see how to change this.
I didn't make the game in mind that it will be easy to change, sry.
But the main version is there.
The host will also choose to play normal mode or equals mode, which gives all the players the same number of cards, any additional cards will be stored in certain rooms.
When a player reached that room, they can view the card hidden there.
This app makes it easy to show players your cards if you need to, without accidentally leaking your own cards.
When you are ready to make an accusation, do it! If you were right, start a new game with 1 simple click!
Might update this in the future to make it easier to make new cards.
